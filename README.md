### How to Install & Use

First make sure to install Node.js. If you don't have Node installed, follow [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and google any questions. There are many resources for Node out there.

With Node installed, run `npm init` or `npm init -y` to initialize the project. Run `npm i` or `npm install` to install the dependencies. The packages used in this application are Inquirer (for prompting the user) and Jest (for running tests). Next, run `node index.js` to start the application. You will then be prompted with a series of questions. The answers will be used to generate an HTML page with your team's information.

Use this app to generate team profiles for any software engineering squad!
